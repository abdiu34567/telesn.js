## Errors You Can Face

### Library Version

as we are working on `updating` our library, then after time there can be different version of the library

- selecting the `specific version` is better
- `HEAD (Developing mode)` cause problems sometimes

### Deployment

as you have many versions depeloyed, sometimes the apps script `stuck` on deployment

- `refreshing` the page may help you solve the problem
- also we recommend not deploy more then `200` versions, you can `clone` the code to different script and start from new deployment

### Trying to run `doPost()` function

you never need to run `doPost` function, because dopost only hears message coming from bot

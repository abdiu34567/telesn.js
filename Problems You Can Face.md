## Problems You Can Face

### Library Version

as we are working on `updating` our library, then after time there can be different version of the library

- selecting the `specific version` is better
- `HEAD (Developing mode)` cause problems sometimes

### Deployment

as you have many versions deployed, sometimes the apps script `stuck` on deployment

- `refreshing` the page may help you solve the problem

### Trying to run `doPost()` function

you never need to run `doPost` function on `webhook`, because dopost only runs automatically when there is a request from bot

### Autocompletion problem

for now autocompletion doesn't have enough resources when it comes to apps script libraries.

-- soon will be improved --

### Session storage

as much as possible keep session storage clean with less data. to much data on session, sometimes cause some exceptions

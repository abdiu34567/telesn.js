## Deployments

> There are 2 types of Deployments in app script

> - `Head deployments (Manage Deployment)`
> - `Versioned deployments (New Deployment)`
>
> **Recommendation**
>
> - use [New Deployment](https://github.com/abdiu34567/telesun.js/blob/main/Deployments/First%20Time%20Deployment.md) when you are deploying your script for the `first time`
> - use [Manage Deployment](https://github.com/abdiu34567/telesun.js/blob/main/Deployments/Manage%20Deployment.md) for deployments `after` first time deployment

## Deployments

> There are 2 types of Deployments in app script
>
> - Head deployments (Manage Deployment)
> - Versioned deployments (New Deployment)
>
> **Recommendation**
>
> - use `New Deployment` when you are deploying your script for the first time
> - use `Manage Deployment` for deployments after first time deployment
>
> ðŸŒŸ _When using New Deployment you need to `copy` the web app Url and use it as webhook Url, but you don't need on Managed Deployment_

### Example

once you `import library`, then you can create the following function and `go send any message to your bot` and **run** `WelcomeToTelesun` function

```js
// send message to your bot, then create the following function and run the function

function WelcomeToTelesun() {
  //pass your bot token
  const bot = new Bot.Telesun(<<botToken>>);

  //will executed always
  bot.Use((ctx) => ctx.reply("Hello World!"));

  //executed when <</start>> command sent to bot
  bot.Start((ctx)=> ctx.reply("This is start Command"))

  //when <hello> message sent
  bot.Hears('hello', (ctx)=> ctx.reply("This is hello message"))

  //when photo sent
  bot.Photo((ctx)=> ctx.reply("This is photo"))
}
```

## Getting started

<br>

### üíä Telegram token

To use the Telegram Bot API, you first have to get a bot account by chatting with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

BotFather will give you a token, something like `123456789:AbCdfGhIJKlmNoQQRsTUVwxyZ`.

<br>

### üë©‚Äçüíª Create Your First Registration bot

‚ûñ The bot will register `username` and `password` by [long polling](https://github.com/abdiu34567/telesun.js/wiki/Long-Polling),`<br>`
‚ûñ then finally we deploy the bot within just 2 clicks as `webhook` on google cloud

> - [Import library](https://github.com/abdiu34567/telesun.js/wiki/Import-Telesun)

```js

/**
 * create function called doPost()
 * copy and paste the following code to your doPost()
 * go and type << /startreg >> command on your bot
 * go back to apps script and run dopost()
 * then check your bot
 *
 */

/**
 * pass your bot token
 * connecting the bot to Telesun Library
*/
const bot = new Bot.Telesun(<<botToken>>);

function doPost(){

 /**
  * when user send /startreg command
  */
  bot.Command('startreg',(ctx)=>{

    //ask user to send thier username
    ctx.reply("Please type Your username ?")

    //save stage that, next the bot is waiting for username
    ctx.setStage("username")
  })

}

```

```js
/**
 * Add the following function to the doPost(), but don't delete the previous code
 * go to bot and send your username
 * go to apps script and run doPost() again
 * then check your bot
 */
function doPost(){

  ......//‚ùå don't remove previos codes

  //if stage is already username
  bot.Stage('username', (ctx)=>{
      //accessing message text as username
      let _Username = ctx.message().text

      //saving to temporary session which lasts 10 minutes by default
      Bot.TSession.set('username', _Username)

      //ask user to send thier password
      ctx.reply("Please type Your password ?")

      //save stage as waiting for password
      ctx.setStage('password')
  })

}
```

```js
/**
 * Add the following function to the doPost(), but don't delete the previous code
 * go to bot and send your password
 * go to apps script and run doPost() again
 * then check your bot
 */
function doPost(){

  ...... //‚ùå don't remove previos codes

  ......//‚ùå don't remove previos codes

   //if stage is already password
  bot.Stage('password', (ctx)=>{

       //accessing username from temporary session
      let _Username = Bot.TSession.getValue('username')

      //send Message as user already finished the registration
      ctx.reply(`User Registered\n\n`+
     `UserName: ${_Username}`+
     `Password: ${ctx.message().text}`)
    }
  })


}


```

<br>

### üì° Deploying Registration Bot

In Order to deploy your bot, first, check :

- your main file is `code.gs`
- your main function is `doPost(e)`

Then, we need to `set webhook` `<br>`

> you can get your `webhook url` after u have followed [Deployment](https://github.com/abdiu34567/telesun.js/wiki/Deployments) steps

```js
/**
 * Create this function and run once, then you can delete it
 */
function settingWebhook() {
  const token = "5862849341:AAHvKz2HGq5y9NBD4B4YAsEI0X9qE";

  //use your webhook url as url object parameter
  Bot.setWebHook(token, { url: "https://..." });
}
```
